Apoache Kafka is Pub-Sub, Multiple Proceducer and Muliple Consumer, Durable enough messgae in Topic, Make message persitant, Message have Time to Live
Proceduer Publish to Kafka Topic, with Durable Messaging System.
Kafka by LinkedIn, Written In Scala,Handling log, sending data from 1 Application to another, Processing Re-processing-->Handling many messages, Time specifice logs, we need to perticular order
Kafka-->Handling message beyween multiple applications, Handling logs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Architecure of Kafka
One Big Cluster multiple Broker
Data Copied in Multiple Broker
Multiple Follower Broker-->leader and Foller broker
Min 3 Broker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.What are Guarantees provided by Kafka?
The order will be same both messages send by producer to perticular topic partition.
Consumers see record, in order they are stored in logs.
also tolrate upto N-1 Failuar without loosing records Commited to logs.

2.Explain some Kafka Streams real-time Use Cases.
Zlando,Twitter,Uber --->ureplicator

3.Topic Replication Factor--> It is very important to factor in topic replication while designing a Kafka system. Hence, 
if in any case, broker goes down its topics’ replicas from another broker can solve the crisis.
4. State one best feature of Kafka.
 The best feature of Kafka is “Variety of Use Cases”. It means Kafka is able to manage the variety of use cases which are very 
common for a Data Lake. For Example log aggregation, web activity tracking, and so on.
-----------------------------------
max.poll.interval.ms defines the delay between the calls to poll()
The maximum delay between invocations of poll() when using consumer group management. This places an upper bound on 
the amount of time that the consumer can be idle before fetching more 
records. If poll() is not called before expiration of this timeout, then the consumer is considered failed

Producer Example
Sppring boot project--->maven , spring boot 3.0--->Correct depency
add spring-Kafka depency
Start Kafka server---> Start Zookeeper--->terminal---> bin/Zookeeper_server.sh config/zookeeper Properties
start kafka_server.properties bin/kafka_server_start.sh config/server.priperties
Specify where ur kafka running
server
port:9191
spring:
kafka:
producer:
booststrap server : localhost

define package--->KafkaMessgaePublisher--->service class
we have Kafka template by spring kafka depencey
