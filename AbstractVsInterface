Class Delared with Abstract Keyword
it allow us to declare method signature using abstract Keyword(abstract Method)
forces its subclass to implement all declared method, if class has method,suppose if class has method that is abstract, then class itself call as abstract
abstract classes don't have any restriction on field and Method Modifiers, while in interface all public by defult, we can have static and instance intialization block in abstract class
we can never have them in interface.
abstract class may also have constructor which will get excecuted during object instantiation.
When to Use an Interface
-problem need to solve using multiple inheritance
-when unrelated claseese implements interface
-application functionality define as Contract, not concern who implemt it.
Consider using the interface when our problem makes the statement “A is capable of [doing this]”.
For example, “Clonable is capable of cloning an object”, “Drawable is capable of drawing a shape”, etc.

When to use Abstract
-we are trying to use inhertance concept in code.
-share code with among many related classes
-providing common base class methods,that subclass can override
-if we have specified requirments and only partial implemtation details.
-If one wants to have non-final or non-static methods to modify the states of an object.
